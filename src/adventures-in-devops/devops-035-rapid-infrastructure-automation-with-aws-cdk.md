Join panelists Nell Shamrell-Harrington, Scott Nixon, Tyler Bird, and special guest Joe Garber to discuss what a digital transformation is, how it’s different from company to company, where to start your transformation and what to do when it gets hard, as well as how organizations across industries are harnessing AI/ML to power their transformations. Also hear us discuss why a digital transformation is never “done” and why that is a good thing!
